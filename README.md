# Quizbowl

## Description
Welcom to A likely Story Quizathon!
I created the quiz program to allow users to come and take a quiz,
if a User is an Admin then they have more options such as editing questions.
All users much register so they can move around my program safely.
Currently only a select group have the admin privliges but feel free to take a quiz and see how you stack up in trivia compared to a bunch of students.



### Executing program
To run this program you need to downlaod all of the requirements, which can be found in the requirments.txt document.
I also made the program in Jupiter Notebook for those who do not wish to download anything/ use a Virtual enviorment. 
From there it's pretty straight forward.
Ready to play?
